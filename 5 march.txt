Spring Boot is not a framework

Why spring boot
What is spring framework
before 10 years
-dependency injection
now much more..so many modules to solve various complex problems

Javascript is a lightweight interpreted or JIT compiled programming language with first class functions. While it is most well known as ..

Why?
Spring boot from official (Spring.io) web..
Promise from spring boot
-container less deployment (container inside app)
-just run

What spring boot gives us?
*create stand alone spring applications
*embed tomcat, jetty or undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
* provide opinionated 'starter' POMs to simplify your Maven configuration
* Automatically configure Spring whenever possible
* provide production ready features such as..
* absolutely no code generation and no requirement XML configuration
* offers fast way to build applications
* focus more on business features and less on infrastructure

Environment set up
JDK 1.8
STS
postman (chrome plugin) / SoapUI

try this activity parallely
open google chrome browser, internet is there, right?
postman plugin (chrome webstore)

multiple ways to create project
*maven project
* web initializer
*command line spring boot
*..

First project
add following dependencies
<parent>
 <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
 <version>1.5.3.RELEASE</version>
</parent>
<dependencies>
 <dependency>
  <groupId..

new -> Spring starter project
service url : http://start.spring.io
Name : demo-1
type : Maven, Java version : 8, Packaging : JAR, Language : Java
Group : com.capgemini
Artifact : firstspringboot
Version : 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
Description : Demo project for spring boot
Package : com.capgemini

Next->
Spring boot version : 2.1.3
available : web, devtools (selected)
//sql -> jpa (according to requirement)
next and finish. it will take time
we will move to slides

first project continued..
package com.capgemini;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.................boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication

*Public static void main
 Starts java and then the application

@SpringBootApplication
* A convenience annotation that wraps commonly used annotations with spring boot
* @Configuration
* @EnableAutoConfiguration
* @ComponentScan

* SpringApplication.run(..);
 Starts Spring, creates spring context, applied annotations and sets..

Controller
*Let's add a controller
* a java class marked with annotation has info about
* what url access triggers it
* what method to run when accessed
* @RestController and @RequestMapping

Returning Object from Controller

right click com.capgemini->new class->MyController

package com.capgemini;

@RestController (web.bind.annotation.RestController)
public class MyController
{
 @RequestMapping("/hello")
 public String getHello()
 {
  return "Message";
 }
}

So i have to change the port number

application.properties
server.port = 8088

localhost:8088/hello (output is Message)

postman me bhi dekhna h output

back to slides:
BOM (Bill of Material)

compatible version automatically it take

Tasks
* instead of returning string object, return employee object
* use GetMapping instead of RequestMapping
